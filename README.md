# hello-world
My first repository
My name is Jason Cen, a 23-year-old Chinese from GuangDong province.I graduated in 2016 and worked for Chinaunion for a year and I found that it was not a suitable job for me.So I started to make changes. Now Im learning Java programing.That's how I started to know about github.
Let's start a new journey!
